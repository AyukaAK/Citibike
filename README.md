1. Citibike_Capacities_Zipcode contains the live station data from July 3, 2022 - json file from that day
This file analyzes the capacity (the number of docks) in each station. Since it does not change unless new bikes or stations are added, I just saved it once

2. Station_Status_July_5 contains the live station data from July 5, 2022 - json files were saved every 10 min for 24h
This file analyzes the live availability of citibikes in all stations in and around NYC

3. Zip_and_total_Capacity is a csv file from the step 1 that was merge into step 2 to create a "master" file
