### Files:
1. Station_Status_July_5 contains the live station data from July 5, 2022 - json files were saved every 10 min for 24h - This file analyzes the live availability of citibikes in all stations in and around NYC

2. Citibike_Capacities_Zipcode contains the station capacity data as of July 3, 2022 - This file analyzes the capacity (the number of docks) in each station. 

3. Zip_and_total_Capacity is a csv file I created by merging the data from 1 and 2 with station ID
